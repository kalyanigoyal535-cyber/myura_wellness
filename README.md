# Myura Clone - React + Tailwind (starter)

## Setup
1. Extract the project.
2. Run `npm install` (this will install react-scripts, tailwind, postcss, autoprefixer, react-router-dom).
3. Place images in `public/assets/` named `hero.jpg` and `product-placeholder.jpg` (or use online placeholders).
4. Run `npm start`.

## Notes
- This is a frontend-only starter made with Create React App + Tailwind CSS.
- If you created the project using CRA earlier, you can copy the `src/` and `public/` contents into your existing project and install Tailwind dependencies.
